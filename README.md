# SQL-ETL-Pipeline
This project demonstrates an ETL pipeline that extracts data from multiple CSV files (containing customer, rental, address, city, country, payment, store, and staff information), performs transformations using Pandas to clean and merge the data, and then loads the results into a SQL database.
